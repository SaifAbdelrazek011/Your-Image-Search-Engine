# Your Image Search Engine

This is my first TypeScript project. The project is summarized in a search engine that you write a word in and click the search button to search for this word and return images for you. The website contains the ability to toggle between dark and light mode, but the default is the dark mode (because I am the creator of the project and see the dark mode better). Moreover, there is a show more button at the end of the results for more results. I have depended on fetching the Unsplash API to return the images. Finally, don't forget to always have fun.

Since this project is currently for Highseas, DM on Slack for any problem reporting, and thank you.
